# Authentication and Authorization Gudiance

## Resources available through Helpful Engineering
Currently Auth0 is the only authentication service provided by Helpful Engineering.  Approved projects are given access to both a development and production authentication [tenant](https://auth0.com/docs/videos/get-started/01-architecture-your-tenant) as needed to allow for environments to host a stable authentication service as well as an environment for testing changes.


## CI/CD (Automation)
Terraform examples are being prepared to allow for automated configuration of Auth0 Tenants via Terraform Cloud or other CI/CD platforms.
