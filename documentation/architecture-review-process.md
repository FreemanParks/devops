# Architecture Review Process

This document describes how the DevOps team will review and provide feedback on Helpful Engineering application
and infrastructure architectures.

## Purpose

The purpose of this review process is to identify 'big' issues early so that we can address them and help the
project provide value to its customers.  

At this point in the development process, the proposed architecture will have (lots of) imprecision or error in the:

* Problem statement
* Benefits a solution will provide to customers
* Key use cases supported by the system
* Design of the solution
* Satisfaction of ‘non-functional’ requirements, particularly security and cost

That's expected.

The architecture review process helps implementors discover issues, clarify the design, and adjust
the solution to something that will solve the problem under Helpful Engineering's organizational constraints. 


## Constraints

Helpful Engineering is a volunteer, non-profit, decentralized organization that operates under important constraints.

The key constraints are:

1. volunteer time is scarce and while there is a broad skill set in aggregate, 
the depth in any one skill is often shallow 
2. money is scarce and the organization's funding model is still developing
3. authority is highly decentralized so mandates
